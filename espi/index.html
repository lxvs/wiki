      <p>
        eSPI (Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface) is born to replace <a href="/lpc" class="red">LPC (Low Pin
        Count)</a> buses.  LPC bus is a legacy bus developed to replace <a href="/isa" class="red">ISA (Industry
        Standard Architecture)</a> bus.

      <p>
        Sideband pin communications between chipset and these devices will be converted to in-band messages through the
        eSPI interfaces as part of the effort to reduce the component pin count and provide a migration path towards
        elimination of high voltage 3.3V I/O pins.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        `Sideband' mentioned above is not the same as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideband" target="_blank">`side-bind' in modulation</a>.  See
        <a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/285786" target="_blank">this post on Stack Exchange</a> for
        more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out-Of-Band (OOB) messaging between Out-Of-Band Processor in the chipset and Embedded Controller (EC) or
        Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) is also tunneled through the new eSPI interface as in-band messages, thus
        replacing the SMBus interface for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run-time flash sharing between chipset and target devices will be supported over this new interface. The target
        devices would be able to access the corresponding Flash partition through the Flash Access channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on applications, eSPI bus may be active in all the S0-S5 system states. To lower the system power, the
        eSPI bus frequency and data pins may be a function of the system state.

        <h3>Controller/Target Mode</h3>
        <p>
          eSPI operates in controller/target mode, where eSPI dictates the flow of command and data between itself and
          the eSPI targets by controlling the <strong>CS# (Chip Select#)</strong> pins for each of the eSPI targets.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="only-one-cs-at-any-time">
        <h3>Only One CS# at Any Time</h3>
        <p>
          At any time, the eSPI controller must ensure that only one of the CS# pins is asserted is asserted based on
          source decode, thus allowing transactions to flow between the eSPI controller and the corresponding eSPI target
          associated with the CS# pin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eSPI controller is the only component allowed to drive CS# when eSPI Reset# is de-asserted.  For an eSPI
          bus, there is only one eSPI controller and one or more eSPI targets.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="single-target">
        <h3>Single Controller-Single Target Configuration</h3>
        <p>
          In Single Controller-Single Target configuration, the eSPI Reset# could be generated by target (eSPI Reset#
          driven from target to controller) or controller (driven from controller to target), depending on the
          configuration.

      <section id="multiple-targets">
        <h3>Single Controller-Multiple Targets Configuration</h3>
        <p>
          Multiple SPI and eSPI targets could be connected to the same eSPI bus interface with a multi-drop Single
          Controller-Multiple Targets configuration.  The number of devices that can be supported over a single eSPI bus
          interface is limited by bus loading and signals trace length.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          In this configuration, the clock and data pins are shared by multiple SPI and eSPI targets.  Each of the targets has its dedicated CS# and Alert# pins.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the configuration with multiple targets presents, the eSPI controller may support 2 eSPI Reset# pins, one
          from target and the other from target.  In this case, the controller's eSPI interface will be reset only when
          all the targets' eSPI interfaces are reset.
        </p>
        <p>
          eSPI targets such as Flash and TPM are allowed to share the same set of clock and data pins with eSPI targets.
          These non-eSPI targets are selected using the dedicated CS# pins and they communicate with the controller
          through SPI specific protocols ran over the eSPI bus.
